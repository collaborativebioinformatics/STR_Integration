## Goals
* To develop a tool to detect and genotype (in terms of length) STR in long reads (_de novo_) without the need of genome annotation beforehand
* This tool should be applicable in mammals and plants (basically any phased eukaryotic assembly)

## Introduction/Description
This tools makes use of phased read alignments to find and genotype STR.
